AN-015 - Application note demonstrating automated control over Quarch Power Studio (QPS)

This example demonstrates adding annotations and datapoints to a QPS stream.

########### VERSION HISTORY ###########

05/06/2018 - Andy Norrie    - First Version.
02/10/2018 - Matt Holsey    - Updated Script for updated QuarchPy Methods.
15/10/2020 - Pedro Cruz     - Updated Script for PAM.
23/03/2023 - Graham Seed    - Reviewed code and updated requirements and instructions.

########### REQUIREMENTS ###########

1- Python (3.x recommended)
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Quarchpy python package
    https://quarch.com/products/quarchpy-python-package/
3- Quarch USB driver (Required for USB connected devices on Windows only)
    https://quarch.com/downloads/driver/
4- Check USB permissions if using Linux:
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/usb/
5- Java 8, with JaxaFX
    https://quarch.com/support/faqs/java/

########### INSTRUCTIONS ###########

1- Connect a Quarch module to your PC via USB, Serial or LAN and power it on.
2- Run the script and follow the instructions on screen.
3- For localhost QPS, run the example as it is.
4- For remote QPS, comment out the 'startLocalQps()' command and specify the IP:Port in the qpsInterface(...) command
   This can also be used if you want to use a different version of QPS and will run it yourself

    Example of adding annotations to the trace.  This can be used to highlight events, errors or
    changes from one part of a test to another.
    
    Annotations can be added in real time, or placed anywhere on the trace as part of post-processing,
    using a timestamp.
    '''
    time.sleep (2)
    myStream.addAnnotation ('Adding an example annotation\\nIn real time!')
    time.sleep (1)

    myStream.addAnnotation ('Adding an example annotation\\nAt a specific time!', annotation_time)

    # Statistics can be fetched from QPS. Stats show the channel data between annotations.

    '''
    Example of adding arbitrary data to the trace.  This allows IOPS, Temperature and similar to be added
    where the data may be polled live from another process, or added in post-process.
    
    Channels need a name (T1 in this example) a 'group' name and a unit of measure.
    The final boolean will create auto SI unit ranges (milli/micro...) automatically if set to true.
    '''
    myStream.addAnnotation('Starting temperature measurement here!')

    writeArbitaryData (myStream, 'T1', 'Temp')
    # End the stream
